0x09-static_libraries

a static library or statically-linked library is a set of routines, external functions and variables which are resolved in a caller at compile-time and copied into a target application by a compiler, linker, or binder, producing an object file and a stand-alone executable.

The benefit of using a static library is that the functions and other symbols loaded into it are indexed. This means instead of having to look for each entity on separate parts of the disk, the program need only reference a single single archived object (. a) file that has ordered the entities together.
